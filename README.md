Mocking HTTP services on [Akka HTTP](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http)
for integration testing.

Port of [NET-A-PORTER/pre-canned](https://github.com/NET-A-PORTER/pre-canned)
from [spray can](http://spray.io) to [Akka HTTP](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http),
cross-compiled for 2.12 and 2.13.

Introduction
------------

Pre-canned helps you to mock out the HTTP services your application depends on. This can be especially useful
for your integration testing.

For SBT add the dependency `"io.github.a-fistful-of-code" %% "pre-canned" % "0.1.1" % "test"`

DSLs
----

Pre-canned currently comes in two flavours:

 * *[`basic`](#basic)* - Simple, but many parentheses
 * *[`fancy`](#fancy)* - Few parentheses, but quite wordy. Also requires to enable postfixOps on Scala 2.13

Help make Pre-canned better and submit a new improved flavour via a PR, or ideas for one in an issue.

There are a basic set of
[expectations](https://github.com/a-fistful-of-code/pre-canned/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/netaporter/precanned/Expectations.scala)
and
[canned responses](https://github.com/a-fistful-of-code/pre-canned/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/netaporter/precanned/CannedResponses.scala).
Feel free to contribute more via a PR.

### basic

```scala
import com.netaporter.precanned.dsl.basic._

val animalApi = httpServerMock(system).bind(8765).block

animalApi.expect(get, path("/animals"), query("name" -> "giraffe"))
  .andRespondWith(resource("/responses/giraffe.json"))
  .blockUpTo(5.seconds)
```

`resource("example.json")` will look for files in `src/main/resources/example.json` or `src/test/resources/example.json`

### fancy

```scala
import com.netaporter.precanned.dsl.fancy._
import scala.language.postfixOps

val animalApi = httpServerMock(system).bind(8766).block

animalApi expect
  get and path("/animals") and query("name" -> "giraffe") and
respond using
  resource("/responses/giraffe.json") end
```

### Adding artificial latency

You can add an artificial latency with `delay()`. For example, adding a 5 second delay:

#### basic DSL

```scala
import scala.concurrent.duration._

animalApi.expect(get, path("/animals"))
  .andRespondWith(resource("/responses/giraffe.json"), delay(5.seconds))
```

#### fancy DSL

```scala
import scala.concurrent.duration._
import scala.language.postfixOps

animalApi expect
  get and path("/animals") and
respond using
  resource("/responses/giraffe.json") and delay(5.seconds) end
```

### Blocking until expectations have been added

Normally, when you use the DSL, expectations are added asynchronously.
To block until an expectation is successfully added, use `blockUpTo = duration`
as shown in the examples below. This will return as soon the expectation has
been added, or the `blockFor` has been reached, whichever is sooner.

#### basic DSL

```scala
import scala.concurrent.duration._

animalApi.expect(get, path("/animals"))
  .andRespondWith(resource("/responses/giraffe.json"))
  .blockUpTo(5.seconds)
```

#### fancy DSL

By default the fancy DSL blocks up to 3 seconds, however you can change it like so:

```scala
import scala.concurrent.duration._

animalApi expect
  get and path("/animals") and
respond using
  resource("/responses/giraffe.json") end(blockUpTo = 5.seconds)
```

You can disable blocking of adding expectations, like so:

```scala
import scala.concurrent.duration._

animalApi expect
  get and path("/animals") and
respond using
  resource("/responses/giraffe.json") end(blockUpTo = Duration.Zero)
```
